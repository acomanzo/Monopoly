# Monopoly
For AP Comp Sci, we were tasked with creating a project of our choice for quarter 4. I decided to make Monopoly with HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, and Bootstrap 4. After I submitted the initial project, I polished the game into it's current state. Now, it uses mainly vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and no bootstrap.
